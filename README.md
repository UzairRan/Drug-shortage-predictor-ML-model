# Drug-shortage-predictor-ML-model

# AI-Powered Drug Shortage Prediction System 

# Overview

This project predicts drug shortage risks and utilization trends using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models trained on FDA Drug Shortages Data and CMS Medicare Part D Utilization Data. The system is deployed via Streamlit, allowing users to make real-time predictions.

# 📊 Data Sources

FDA Drug Shortages Dataset → Tracks reported drug shortages and resolved statuses.

CMS Medicare Part D Utilization Dataset → Provides historical drug usage and spending data to analyze shortage patterns.

# Features & Predictions

✔ FDA Shortage Classifier → Predicts drug shortage risk based on 11 key features. ✔ CMS Utilization Forecast → Uses an LSTM model to predict drug utilization trends.
